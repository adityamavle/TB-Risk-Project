This project is a FastAPI-based application designed to simulate datasets based on various population parameters. It offers endpoints for dataset simulation, statistical power calculation, optimization of sample sizes, and generation of clinical datasets.

## Features
- **Simulate Dataset**: Generate datasets based on user-defined population parameters.
- **Calculate Statistical Power**: Compute the statistical power for different treatment groups.
- **Optimize Sample Size**: Adjust sample size to achieve desired statistical power.
- **Generate Clinical Dataset**: Create a clinical dataset with an equal number of samples from each population group.
